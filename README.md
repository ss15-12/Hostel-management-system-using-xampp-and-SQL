## Introduction
The Hostel Management System (HMS) is a database management system project that aims
to provide an efficient and comprehensive solution to hostel management. The system is
designed to facilitate the management of hostel resources, including room allocation, student
records, fee collection, mess management, and other related services. The project utilizes the
power of DBMS to provide real-time information and generate various reports related to
hostel management, thereby improving the decision-making process. The system includes
various modules for student and management interfaces, mess management, fee collection,
and room inventory management, among others. Additionally, the system provides advanced
features such as room reallocation, laundry management, manager appointment, and room
layout management. The project is expected to streamline hostel management operations,
reduce errors and redundancy, and enhance the overall efficiency of hostel management.

## Workflow

This project is aimed at developing a system for keeping records and showing
information about or in a hostel. This system will help the hostel officer to be able
to manage the affairs of the hostel. This system will provide full information about
a student in the hostel. It will show rooms available or not and number of people
in a particular room. This will also provide information on students who have paid
in full or still owe. This system will also provide a report on the summary detail
regarding fees and bills students are owing. Also included is a user module for
employees or the hostel officer. There will also be an administrator module which
will access by the administrator and has the ability to delete, add and edit
employee records. This system will be developed based on Software Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) with PHP and My SQL server. PHP is good for the
development and design of web based programs whiles My SQL is good for
databases because of its security and its advanced features and properties.
